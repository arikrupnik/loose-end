# loose-end: Rocket Glider Research Program

I have a loose end I've been meaning to tie since 2012--a large R/C rocket glider.

Loose End uses wire-cut foam wing cores and a 3D printed fuselage.

First version uses off-the-shelf wings and fins from a HobbyKing RadJet800.
It has a 24mm motor mount.
This version has flown on E9, E15, E6 and F12 motors.

Fuselage prints upright, in sections.
Most pieces use a single perimeter and 2% infill.
Spar carrythrough (green in the image below) uses 30% infill.
This part allows me to cut wing spar in two and the motor to pass through the wing, similar to mid-wing jet flighters like MiG-21 or F-16.
